# Melodify

**Hello Stranger!** Welcome to this little endeavour of mine into the strange and mysterious world of AI and neural 
networks.

**What is Melodify?**
To put it in a nutshell, it's basically an AI driven melody generator that yields unique melodies at the push of a 
button. These newly generated melodies are stored in a MIDI clip, so that you have the freedom do design the sound and 
character of these melodies to your liking.

But before we can dive in, we have to talk about the requirements to run this project.

###Requirements
1. Make sure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed
2. Install the latest distribution of Pytorch on your machine
3. *optional:* Install the latest version of CUDA by Nvidia to run the code on your GPU. This will greatly improve the 
performance and speed things up, no matter if you try to train the neural network yourself or to just push the button to
create new melodies.
